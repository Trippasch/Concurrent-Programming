Compile:

    To compile this assignment we included a Makefile to make
    the process much easier. All you hava to to is run the
    command:
        
        $ make all

    You can find each make target inside the Makefile.

Execution:
    
    To execute the program run the command:

        $ ./assignment1 <int> <input_file>

    where <int> is the size of the buffer and <input_file>
    is a file from which we get input. After execution, a
    file called `output` will be created. Using the command:

        $ diff <input_file> output

    we check if the job was done correctly.

    For your convenience we include "mega_book.txt" to be used
    as large input and "mini.txt" to be used as a small input.
