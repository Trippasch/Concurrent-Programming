Compile:

    To compile this assignment we included a Makefile to make
    the process much easier. All you hava to to is run the
    command:

        $ make all

    You can find each make target inside the Makefile.

Execute:

    To execute the program, run the command:

        ./bridge

    The program requires input
    from standard input, so in our case we redirect stdin to
    a file from the folder ./tests which has different cases of generated cars.
    So the execution command should be:

        ./bridge < tests/test1.txt
